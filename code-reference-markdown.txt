## Creating a slide:
To create a new slide the only thing needed is to add a div html element with the class slide, the javascript automatically numbers the slides according to their position in the dom.
### At code time
```html
    <div class="slide">
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
    </div>
```
### At run time
```html
    <div class="slide" id="slide-1">
    </div>
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2">
    </div>
```

## Mark a element as auto-read:
In order to designate an html element as auto-read, add the class js-read-auto to the element to be read. The code automatically adds this element into a queue in the order they appear in the DOM.
```html
    <div class="js-read-auto">
        Read my text.
    </div>
```
## Audio file storage:
In order to read an element you have to specify which audio file should be played, this is done by storing the audio in a particular way. `/assets/audio/slide-{slide number}/audio-{audio number}.{audio extension}`
### Example
```html
    <div class="slide" id="slide-1">
        <div class="js-read-auto">
            Read my text.
        </div>
    </div>
```
#### The audio should be stored at `/assets/audio/slide-1/audio-1.mp3`
#### Video for this read-block should be stored in a similar way in `/assets/video/slide-1/video-1.mp4`

## Making an exercise:
To make an exercise at lest 2 classes should be present. `js-ejercicio-parent` which indicates which element is the parent of all the exercise elements and `js-ejercicio` that is an instance of an exercise.
```html
    <div class="js-ejercicio-parent">
        <button class="js-ejercicio" data-is-right="true">
            This is the right answer
        </button>
        <button class="js-ejercicio" data-is-right="false">
            This is a wrong answer
        </button>
        <button class="js-ejercicio" data-is-right="false">
            This is a another wrong answer
        </button>
    </div>
```
#### When a button is pushed a sound is played and a class is added to indicate that it was either a success or a wrong answer. Those are `ejercicio-correct` and `ejercicio-incorrect`
